!) What data are useful?

explanation: 

TSH = Thyroid stimulating hormone. 
High TSH levels can mean your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormones, 
a condition called hypothyroidism.
--Low TSH levels can mean your thyroid is making too much of the hormones, 
a condition called hyperthyroidism.--
!) A TSH test does not explain why TSH levels are too high or too low

T3 = T3 is a second thyroid hormone that is produced by the thyroid gland, 
but also in other tissues through deiodination (enzymatic conversion) of T4. 
T3 helps maintain muscle control, brain function and development,
heart and digestive functions.

TΤ4 = Thyroxine (T4) is responsible for your metabolism, mood, and body temperature, among other things. 
T3, too, is made in the thyroid gland, and it can also be made in other tissues within the body by converting T4
(in a process called deiodination) into T3.

Τ4U = Subset of t4

FTI =Free thyroid index .The free T4 index (FTI) is a blood test used to diagnose thyroid disorders. 
T4,also called thyroxine, is a thyroid hormone. The test measures how much of it is in your blood to help determine whether your thyroid gland is underactive
 (hypothyroidism) or overactive (hyperthyroidism).
